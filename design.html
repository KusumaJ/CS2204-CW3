        <h2>Description for CW3</h2>

        <h3>For the <span>Event Handlers</span></h3>
        <p>I set up in HTML on </p>
        <ul>
            <li><span><a href="ticket.html">ticket</a> </span>page where seats are selected </li>
            <li><span><a href="index.html">index</a></span> page where video should be changed</li>
            ps.though those are written in script, they're inside the html tag
        </ul>
        <p>I set up in JS in <span>every single page</span> using the document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded',..some function..)
            because a lot of scripts should be run after page is loaded and I don't want to put the script in the last
            line
        </p>

        <h3>For the <a href="./index.html">Index</a> page: mainly divided into 3 division</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I use js to generate information related to the movies (data given in separated js file <a href="./js/movies.js">movies.js</a>)</li>
            <li>I use function changevid to deal with the video changes due to user'clicks </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the <a href="./nowshowing.html">Now Showing</a></h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I use js to generate information related to the movies plus the cinemas (data given in separated js file <a href="../js/movies.js">movies.js</a> and also
                <a href ="http://courses.cs.cityu.edu.hk/cs2204/cw3/cinemas.js">cinemas.js</a>)</li>
            <li>I use js to instantly change the details of the available movies when new cinema is selected</li>
            <li>Some parts of the script are also written to provide detail for the next page (via form; get method)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the <a href="./ticket.html">Ticket</a> page</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I retrieve information from the url. Then, keep and make use of it in a proper form</li>
            <li>I use function clickFunc() to deal with the events that user select the seat (show info/ reserve the seat by color)</li>
            <li>Some parts of the script are also written to provide detail for the next page (via form; get method)</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the <a href="./print.html">Print</a> page</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>I retrieve information from the url and make use of it in a proper form</li>
            <li>I use js to generate the html of each ticket to be printed</li>
        </ul>

                <h2>Sketch Diagram</h2>
                <p>For the <span>header</span>, I use the animation to move the logo above the site name under the given
                    condition<br>
                    (I give some styles to the logo img because when it moves, it will have the color bg as the real bg
                    is transparent)</p>
                <p>For the <span>menu</span>, I fix it at the top and disable the link of the current page</p>
                <p>For the <span>footer</span>, I put text in the center. Also, I use border top to make the section
                    clearer</p>
                <p>I also use the <span>&lt;section&gt;</span> in order to arrange the content part</p>
            </div>
        </div>

        <h3>For the <span>Stylesheet</span></h3>
        <p>I use 2 sheets: one for the whole sites [style.css] and one specifically for the printing [mediaprint.css].
        </p>
        <p>Styles are grouped on every page depending on necessity as I try not to overuse the id and class selection.
            Detail of the whole theme is given above. Other specific detail for each page will be given below.</p>

        <h3>For the <span>CSS3 features</span>: position(line) mentioned are on style.css </h3>
        <ul>
            <li><span>Rounded corners</span> are used several times: header image(line 27), header (line 36),
                #movieexample on homepage
                and #booklocation on nowshowing page (line 101), #confirmbook input on ticket page (line 170),
                submit button on nowshowing page (line 230) </li>
            <li><span>Gradient color</span> is also used here for the background of the division of the movie on
                homepage (line 121) to make the division clear and pretty but not messy</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>For the <a href="./index.html">Home</a> page: mainly divided into 3 division</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span>movieexample</span> here contains videos</li>
            <li><span>nowshowing</span> consists of 3 movies with image and text. I include a link to the nowshowing
                page as it will suggest the user to look further into detail about booking</li>
            <li><span>upcoming</span> goes the same way with nowshoeing but there is no link to another page</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the <a href="./nowshowing.html">Now Showing</a> page: mainly divided into 3 division</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><span>booklocation form</span> allows user to choose location. Later on, it can be actually used with
                the help of javascript</li>
            <li><span>booknowshowing</span> consists of 3 movies' form with timeslots to book</li>
            <li><span>locations</span> contains 3 locations (map image plus address)</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the <a href="./ticket.html">Ticket</a> page</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Headings: here all information are important so I use h3 tags alone for all</li>
            <li><span>seatplan</span> with table visualizes the plan of the theatre well</li>
            <li><span>confirmbook</span> using form</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>For the <a href="./print.html">Print</a> page</h3>
        <p>Simple divs are used only to separate each ticket apart</p>
        <p>Distinct stylesheet is used for the print purpose to hide header, footer, and other unwanted information as
            well as make one ticket stay in one single page</p>

        <h3>Acknowledgement</h3>
